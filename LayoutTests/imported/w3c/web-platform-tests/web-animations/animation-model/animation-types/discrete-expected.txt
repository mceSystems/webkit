FAIL Test animating discrete values assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at exact middle of the interval expected "italic" but got "normal"
FAIL Test discrete animation is used when interpolation fails assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at exact middle of the interval expected "200px" but got "0px"
FAIL Test discrete animation is used only for pairs of values that cannot be interpolated assert_equals: First non-interpolable pair uses discrete interpolation expected "200px" but got "0px"
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the effect easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at 96% of the iteration time expected "italic" but got "normal"
FAIL Test the 50% switch point for discrete animation is based on the keyframe easing assert_equals: Animation produces 'to' value at 96% of the iteration time expected "italic" but got "normal"
